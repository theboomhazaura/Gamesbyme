A tiny, static game hub. No build step, no framework — plain HTML/CSS/JS, ready to deploy on GitHub Pages.

## Structure

```
index.html      the hub page (hero + shelf of cartridges)
styles.css      all styling
games.js        the list of games — this is the only file you edit to add a game
script.js       renders cartridge cards from games.js
games/          one folder per game, each with its own index.html
```

## Adding a game

1. Make a folder under `games/`, named with a URL-friendly slug, e.g. `games/rocket-dodge/`.
2. Put that game's `index.html` (and any css/js it needs) inside that folder. It can be entirely self-contained.
3. Open `games.js` and add one entry:

   ```js
   {
     title: "Rocket Dodge",
     slug: "rocket-dodge",
     description: "Dodge asteroids, don't blow up.",
     color: "clay"   // optional — "clay" | "moss" | "teal"
   },
   ```

4. Refresh `index.html` — a new cartridge card appears automatically, linking to `games/rocket-dodge/index.html`.

There's a placeholder game at `games/example-game/` you can look at, edit, or delete.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repo on GitHub and push this folder's contents to it:

   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Set up The Shelf"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. On GitHub, go to **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to `Deploy from a branch`, branch `main`, folder `/ (root)`.
4. Save. GitHub will give you a URL like `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo>/` — that's your live site.
5. Every time you push new games or edits to `main`, the site redeploys automatically (usually within a minute).

## Notes

- Everything is static, so any game you build with just HTML/CSS/JS will work.
- Keep each game folder self-contained (its own assets, no shared globals) to avoid games clashing with each other.
